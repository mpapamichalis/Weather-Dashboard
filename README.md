# Weather-Dashboard
This website allows the user to search for a major city anywhere in the world and returns the current weather for that city. It also returns the 5 day forceast for that area. After each search, the search is logged so that the user can see what cities they have already searched for. If the user selects one of the cities in their search history, the weather data for that city will be displayed.

The weather data in the website is provided by openWeatherApi (third party API). Specifically, the jQuery ajax method is used to make the GET requests from this api.
